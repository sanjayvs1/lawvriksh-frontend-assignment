# Cover Note

This repository contains both phases of the LawVriksh frontend assignment.

- Phase 1 (in `phase1/`): UX brief, annotated screens, motion plan, and laws applied.
- Phase 2 (in `phase2/`): Responsive Next.js implementation using shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and purposeful micro‑interactions.

Highlights (≤200 words):
- Implemented the dashboard per reference with clear visual hierarchy: greeting banner, KPIs + chart, profile completion, subscribers, and profile meta.
- Added at least five micro‑interactions following the Phase 1 timings/easings: hero entrance, KPI count‑up, progress bar fill, subscribers row hover/press, tooltip emphasis, and button press feedback. All respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Accessibility: visible focus rings, adequate contrast, fully clickable rows, and keyboard‑friendly order.
- Responsive layout across desktop/tablet/mobile with wrapping columns and overflow‑safe cards.

Run locally: see `phase2/README.md`. Live demo can be deployed to Vercel/Netlify.
